2. GRANT OF RIGHTS (INITIAL TERMS)

This License acts as a governance wrapper over the specific usage rights
granted for The IP.

  2.1 Initial Terms

  Your rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,
  and/or sell copies of The IP are governed by the Initial Terms. The Initial
  Terms may define different permissions for different files, directories, or
  modules within The IP (for example, permissive open-source licenses for some
  components and restricted or commercial terms for others).

  The default Initial Terms for this repository are described in the file
  INITIALTERMS.md.

  2.2 Conflict of Terms

  In the event of a conflict between the Initial Terms and this TIPL regarding
  usage of The IP, the Initial Terms shall control to the extent required to
  preserve irrevocable rights granted under those Initial Terms, including
  rights granted under open-source licenses.

  In the event of a conflict regarding ownership, governance, or the Tender
  Offer mechanism, this TIPL shall control.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. THE TENDER OFFER MECHANISM (BUYOUT CLAUSE)

The authority of the current Controlling Party and the applicability of the
Initial Terms are subject to a buyout mechanism governed by the following
terms.

  3.1 Initiation of Tender Offer

  Any party (the "Purchaser") may seek to become the Controlling Party by
  initiating a Tender Offer. The Tender Offer must:

  1. Be open to ALL current Token Holders.
  2. Specify a fixed Offer Price per Token.
  3. Include a legally binding commitment or smart-contract escrow to purchase
     ALL Tokens tendered by Token Holders at the Offer Price.

  3.2 Change of Control

  If, at the conclusion of the Tender Offer, the Purchaser has acquired
  ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the Maximum Token Supply, a
  Change of Control Event is deemed to have occurred.

  3.3 Effect of Change of Control

  Upon verification of a Change of Control Event:

  1. Transfer of Control: The Purchaser immediately becomes the Controlling
     Party.
  2. Right to Modify Terms: The Controlling Party gains the right to cancel,
     replace, or modify the Initial Terms with respect to all versions of The
     IP, past and future, except to the extent that such modification is
     prohibited by irrevocable open-source licenses or applicable law.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. CONTINUITY OF OPEN SOURCE RIGHTS

  4.1 Irrevocable Open Source Licenses

  If the Initial Terms granted a perpetual, irrevocable open-source license
  (including but not limited to licenses approved by the Open Source
  Initiative) for any portion or version of The IP, such rights CANNOT BE
  REVOKED for that portion or version.

  In the event of a conflict between an open-source license and any modified
  license issued by a Controlling Party, the open-source license shall
  prevail.

  4.2 No Other Protected Expectations

  Except as provided in Section 4.1, no user or licensee is granted any
  expectation that the Initial Terms will remain unchanged following a Change
  of Control Event.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
